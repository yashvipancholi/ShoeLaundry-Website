      <h1>Vision Behind Our Shoe Laundry </h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="about-col">
          <p>  Our shoes are not only the part of our outfit that reflects our personality but also the part of our outfit that needs to withstand dirt and germs the most. We may get stains on our shirts from pollution or dirt outside, but our shoes are constantly exposed to filth and bacteria. Consequently, our shoes may get sick. We offer a system of cleaning shoes that provides a systematic process for your valued possessions.
          <br>
          <br> It is not uncommon to find dhobis or workshops that clean shoes in unhygienic conditions, the same goes for carpets, leather, and other goods. In most cases, boring water is used, which is hard and has not been processed yet. As a result, dirt is gone from your shoes, but germs and other adulterated elements may be riding on them after they have been laundered.
          <br>
          <br> Generally, shoe laundries follow a simple and uniform cleaning process. It involves dipping your shoes in water or locally made chemicals, scrubbing them, polishing them, and giving them back to you. Most people are unaware that leather does not all have the same properties. In addition, rugged leather comes in many varieties, including top-grain leather, woven leather, and embossed leather. Similarly, there are several material types in Sports Shoes, including knit fabric, synthetic fiber, canvas, natural rubber, foam, etc. We follow the exact pattern of treatment, which is recommended by the Shoe and Leather Council, and perform the entire process in-house, under hygienic conditions.

          <h1>Cleaning your sneakers:</h1>
          <p>
          <br>Increases their lifespan:
          <br>With every step you take, you run the risk of stepping into something undesirable. If not treated, your trainers will collect dust, dirt, pollen, moisture, and more, which can lead to discoloration and staining. To prevent stubborn stains from setting within the materials, we recommend cleaning them every two weeks. 
          <br>
          <br>Make sure your investment is protected:
          <br>The sneaker reselling market is growing as the sneaker community grows. You'll find now it's hard to find a pair of worn shoes for a cheap price. There's no need to buy shoes to wear and then send them to a landfill when they're dirty! Protect your investment by getting them cleaned regularly.
          <br>
          <br>Prevents damage:
          <br>When your shoes get dirty you should wipe them down or clean them as soon as possible. This is because dirt and grime have natural oils within them. These oils can do a lot more damage to the material the longer it's sat there. They can shrink, add bad odors and also break down the rubber soles.
